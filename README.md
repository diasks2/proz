# ProZ

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/proz.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/proz) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/diasks2/proz/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

ProZ is a Ruby wrapper for the [ProZ.com API](http://www.proz.com/api-docs). The ProZ.com 2.0 API is a REST-like API for interacting with ProZ.com services.

## Install

**Ruby**  
*Supports Ruby 2.1.5 and above*  
```
gem install proz
```

**Ruby on Rails**  
Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:  
```ruby 
gem 'proz'
```

## Usage

#### Directory Service API

##### Freelancer

Get a representation of a single freelancer by providing that freelancer's [uuid](http://www.proz.com/api-docs/formats/uuid). The uuid is not provided publicly by ProZ so you have to obtain it either through the Freelancer Match API or the OAuth2 API.

```ruby
freelancer = Proz::Freelancer.new(key: 'yourAPIkey', uuid: '663e4488-58a1-4713-992c-c6d90aafa3cb')

freelancer.site_name
# => 'Smartranslators'
```

**Supported Methods**  
* `uuid`
* `site_name`
* `profile_url`
* `contact_info`
* `skills`

Further details for each method can be found in the [ProZ API Specification](http://www.proz.com/api-docs/types/freelancer).

##### Freelancer Matches

Get freelancers that match a set of criteria. A [language pair](http://www.proz.com/api-docs/formats/language-pair) is required for this query. The language pair code should be in the form of a source language code, an underscore, and a target language code. The language codes are a variation of an earlier version of the ISO 639-2 standard, so please check the [ProZ language code](http://www.proz.com/api-docs/codes/language) list to make sure you have the correct language code.

You can pass any number of [optionial parameters](http://www.proz.com/api-docs/directory/get-freelancer-matches). The default number of freelancers returned is 10.

```ruby
fm = Proz::FreelancerMatches.new(key: 'yourAPIkey', language_pair: 'eng_esl')
fm.freelancer_matches[0]['freelancer']['uuid']
# => '663e4488-58a1-4713-992c-c6d90aafa3cb'

fm = Proz::FreelancerMatches.new(key: 'yourAPIkey', language_pair: 'eng_esl', min_yrs_proz: 10, country_code: 'us')
fm.freelancer_matches[0]['freelancer']['uuid']
# => 'b9eade6d-33ac-4c7d-b6f1-42905375fc0b'
```

#### OAuth2

To Setup Your App with ProZ OAuth2

1. Create an account on [ProZ.com](https://www.proz.com)

2. Register an [API client app](https://www.proz.com/oauth/client-apps)

  You will be assigned a `client_id` and `client_secret`. You will need to choose a `redirect_uri`. For example, you could choose something like: `redirect_uri: https://www.yourdomain.com/proz` or `redirect_uri: https://www.yourdomain.com`  

3. Create a route in your project for the above `redirect_uri` if that route does not already exist.
  If you are building a Rails app, an example might be:

  *config/routes.rb*  

  ```ruby
  match '/proz', to: 'static_pages#proz', via: :get
  ```

4. Create a link within your app  
  *controller*
  ```ruby
  proz = Proz::OAuth.new(client_id: 'yourClientID', client_secret: 'yourClientSecret', redirect_uri: 'yourRedirectURI')
  @oauth_link = proz.link
  ```

  *view*
  ```ruby
  <%= link_to "Link your ProZ.com Account", @oauth_link %>
  ```

5. Exchange authorization code for tokens  
  ```ruby
  token = proz.exchange_code_for_token(params[:code])
  ```

6. Save the token and refresh token  
  ```ruby
  current_user.update_columns(proz_oauth_token: token['access_token'], proz_refresh_token: toekn['refresh_token'])
  ```

7. Retrieve the user's profile info  
  ```ruby
  proz = Proz::Profile.new(token: token)
  proz.uuid
  # => '7bbfdd74-a2a4-484f-8dbc-215a67026ce1'

  proz.site_name
  # => 'Kevin Dias'

  proz.profile_url
  # => 'http://www.proz.com/profile/1979687'
  ```

  **Supported Methods**  
  * `uuid`
  * `site_name`
  * `profile_url`
  * `contact_info`
  * `skills`

Further details for each method can be found in the [ProZ API Specification](http://www.proz.com/api-docs/types/freelancer).
